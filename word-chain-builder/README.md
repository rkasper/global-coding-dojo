# Coding Kata: Word Chain Builder

Here's a fun coding kata that works well for multiple skill levels:

## Problem Description

Create a program that builds valid word chains, where each word differs from the previous word by exactly one letter. For example:

```
cat → cot → cog → dog
```

In this chain, we changed one letter at a time to form a new valid word.

## Requirements

1. ✅ Your program should accept a start word and an end word as input.
2. It should output a valid word chain connecting these words (if possible).
3. Each word in the chain must be a valid dictionary word.
4. Each transition changes exactly one letter while maintaining the same word length.
5. If no valid chain exists, return an appropriate message.

## Extensions (for advanced participants)

- Find the shortest possible word chain
- Allow for different word lengths in the chain (adding/removing one letter)
- Build a visualization showing the transformation
- Implement multiple solution strategies and compare their performance

This kata combines graph algorithms, dictionary processing, and search strategies. Beginners can start with a simple solution that works for small dictionaries, while more advanced participants can optimize for performance or implement the extensions.
