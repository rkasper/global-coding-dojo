# FizzBuzz Kata - Part 1 Requirements
For the first part of the FizzBuzz kata, here are the core requirements:

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

This creates a sequence that starts: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, ...
