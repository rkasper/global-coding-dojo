# FizzBuzz Kata - Part 1 Requirements
For the first part of the FizzBuzz kata, here are the core requirements:

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

This creates a sequence that starts: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, ...

## What we did today
- Write small pieces of kind, one small piece at atime
- Make one small test pass
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): write the tests first, then write the product code
- Pair Programming / Mob Programming: write the code together, each person takes a turn as "driver" while the others "navigate"
- Learn some TypeScript

## What if testers and developers are working together on a team?
- Testing is good. Test coverage is good. It helps us deliver a high quality thing, with no defects.
  - Unit test for new code, regression tests for existing code...
- If something is good, we should amplify it to an extreme level - by doing it all the time. Test all the time is called Test-Driven Development. (from Extreme Programming, 1999-2000, Kent Beck)
- Idea: developers and testers work together all the time
- Does it slow down the team? Example: one team mobbed together. The team was high performing. Everyone was everyone else's backup - the team never slowed down. => Do that again.
