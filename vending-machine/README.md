## The Vending Machine Kata
You need to simulate a vending machine that:

1. ✅ Accepts coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
2. Allows selection of products with different prices
3. Returns correct change
4. Handles insufficient funds
5. Tracks inventory of products

**Products:**
- Soda: $1.25
- Chips: $0.75
- Candy: $0.50

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Accept coins one at a time
- ✅ Display current amount inserted
- Allow product selection
- Dispense product and change when payment is sufficient
- Return all coins when "coin return" is pressed
- Handle "sold out" products
- Exact change only when machine can't make change

**Edge cases to consider:**
- What happens when exact change can't be made?
- How do you handle overpayment?
- What if a product is selected but payment is insufficient?
- How do you track and update inventory?

This kata scales nicely - beginners can focus on basic functionality while advanced developers can tackle complex change-making algorithms, state management, and edge cases. Everyone can contribute at their level!
